I am adept at creating process improvement through work automation and focused leadership. I have combined my program management skills with cutting-edge web development skills that I have curated through an intensive 14-week coding bootcamp. I build web apps because I love the satisfaction of learning and applying viable new skills and challenging my brain through code! I am mainly proficient in Python, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript/React HTML and CSS. I regularly use these as well as other modules/libraries such as MatPlotLib, Pandas and Numpy. In my free time, I enjoy running, attending HIIT classes and stray cat rescue and rehabilitation" ,
